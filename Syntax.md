# Introduction #

As I've been doing more and more with this, the number of parameters has grown somewhat.  So, here's the documentation.


# Details #

vv.php is the main workhourse here.
vl.php is an example script to read all files in a directory and display them.
vb.php is a viewdata browser, with which you can navigate pages based on the routing tables they include.  This currently only works for SoftMachinery format frames.

## vv.php ##
Call with vv.php?option=value&option=value...

It may be the target of an HTML "img" tag if you expect it to return an image, an "iframe" tag if you expect it to return text, or just linked to directly.

| **option** | **values** |
|:-----------|:-----------|
| gal        | folder to locate pages within, defaults to 'frames' |
| page       | file to display within above folder |
| text       | if 'page' is not defined, and this is, display this text |
| offset     | default=0, skip specified number of bytes from start of file |
| height     | height, default 24, depending on frame format |
| width      | width, default 40 |
| top        | additional line of text to display above image (not inc. in height param) |
| longdesc   | default 0=display image, 1=plain text with graphics omitted, 2="pre" text with graphics replaced by asterisks |
| thumbnail  | default=0 display full size, 1-3 size to n\*100 pixels wide |
| format     | 0=auto, 1="mode 7", 2=SoftMac, 3=raw, 4=ABZTtxt, 5=Axis Microbase, 6=!SVReader.  +16 maps "." in 'page' to "/", +32 to disable read cache, +64 to disable write cache, +128 to disable black text, +256 to make filename case insensitive, +512 "top" line text above replaces top line of image file. |

A typical example of it's use might be:
`<img src="vv.php?format=2&gal=frames&page=1069a" longdesc="vv.php?format=2&longdesc=1&gal=frames&page=1069a" />`
`<br />`
`<small>``<a href="vv.php?format=2&longdesc=2&gal=frames&page=1069a">`View as text`</a>``</small>`
