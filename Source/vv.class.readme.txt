
Rob's Viewdata Viewer Class.  The Documentation.

Project home page: http://code.google.com/p/viewdataviewer/
Alternate information: http://www.irrelevant.com/vv/

The vv.php, vl.php and vb.php codebase grew to the state it's in very
organically, and without any proper design.  This re-write of the core code
is intended to address this, and produce a proper API for accessing original-
format viewdata page files.

This should ensure that the application programmes can deal with viewdata
format files without any need to know themselves about the format.  This will
avoid the situation in place with the above mentioned routines where each
addresses different aspects of some files, with much duplication and some
contradiction.

current version 0.6.0 - 2011-02-06 (pre-alpha incomplete functionality.)

include "vv.class.php";
defines a number of constants defining viewdata types and modifiers.
function vvtypes($val)  returns string relating to type specified, or FALSE.

	returns:
		TRUE - file loaded and analysed
		FALSE - file not found or of unrecognised type

$vfile->format - format of file
$vfile->framesfound - number of frames found within file
$vfile->frameindex = array(key=>Array(.."offset"..) - offset within file

		note that key may not necesarilly be 0,1,2,3 etc, especially where files
		contain interlinked pages!  Expect such as "1a" "ss.0a"  ..


$vfile->ReturnMetaData($idx, $param)
		$idx - key to frame within file (see above)  NULL for first(or only)
		$param - metadata item required, e.g. "route0".
	returns:
		value of paramater
		FALSE - no such frame or parameter for this frame type

	Different frame formats support different ranges of parameters. Many support

$vfile->ReturnScreen($idx,$mode)
		$idx - key to frame within file (see above)  NULL for first(or only)
		$mode - "internal" - screendata in simple 7bit internal format.
				"simple" - screen data with control codes only removed
