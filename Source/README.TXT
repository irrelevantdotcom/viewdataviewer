Please note that you will require a font file.	You may use the files supplied
within the Font folder, however these are derived from a file supplied with
"BeebEm" and is licenced seperately. (GNU)

Please note that GIFEncoder.class.php is included for completeness.  Licencing
requirements for this are unclear as it was taken from a GIF tutorial web page.


THIS IS CURRENTLY A WORK-IN-PROGRESS AND AS SUCH MAY BE OUT OF DATE ALREADY!
PLEASE DO NOT RELY ON THIS IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT CAREFUL
CONSIDERATION OF THIS AND WITHOUT CHECKING FOR UPDATES FIRST.


Files included herein:
vv.php	- viewdata viewer- this is the main focus of the project.
vl.php	- gallery type lister - copy of script from my site that uses vv.php
vb.php  - simple viewdata browser (for SofMac/Gnome format frames)
GIFEncoder.class.php - Animated gif encoder (see comments for author)
fntfilecreator.bbc - program to create required GDF font files.

Suitable fonts are included in the fonts directory.  You may co-locate these
alongside vv.php, or leave them in the directory and adjust the references 
within vv.php to the correct path.

Please ensure you create a folder 'cache' in the same folder as vv.php
and allow write access to it.


vv.php - display a viewdata/teletext frame as an image
------------------------------------------------------
parameters:
gal=<folder>
page=<filename> OR text=<text to display>
offset=<bytes> default=0, skip <bytes> from start of file.
width=<columns>
height=<lines> (of source file, not incl. "top")
longdesc=<mode> 0(default)=graphic, 1=text, 2=<pre>text with * for graphics.
thumbnail=<tn size> 0(default)=full size, 0<n<3 = n*100 pixel wide image.
top=<text> optional line to insert above image (see also format b9)
format=<option bits>
--format b9 = "top" text overwrites top line in file.
--format b8 = attempts to be case insensitive on page->filenames.
--format b7 = disable black as a colour
--format b6 = disable writing rendered file to cache
--format b5 = disable checking cache for pre-rendered file
--format b4 = maps . in pagename to / in filename
--format bits 0-3  file type override

vl.php - display a web page showing all frames in a folder
----------------------------------------------------------
This should be treated as an example of how to use vv.php, as it is taken
from my website and therefore tailored towards that (and currently is in a
state of flux, anyway!)
parameters:
gal=<folder>
layout=<layout>  0=horizintal, 1=vertical
cols=<table cols> default 4/1 for horiz/vert
baseurl=<prefix>

If a file is found with a matching .txt file, that file is read to obtain
a title (line 1) and description (rest of lines).  The title is shown under
the thumbnail for horizontal view, and both are shown alongside it for
vertical view.

If a file "index.txt" is found in the gallery folder, then it is used to 
source titles and descriptions for any files without their own .txt
line format is
filename:title:description
or
filename+offset:title:description

This is intended to be used as a component frame to a larger web page.



fontfilecreator.bbc
-------------------
required BBC Basic For Windows.
http://www.compulink.co.uk/~rrussell/bbcwin/bbcwin.html
(This will work with free demo version.)

Required if you wish to use another font file to that supplied.
